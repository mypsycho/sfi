SFI : Software Factory Installer


This tool is an open source installer of web applications and solutions stack.


Concept
--------------
Most of current applications are based on the similar pattern:
- installation by unpack
- copy of plugins in a specific directory
- SQL and  LDAP compatibles
The main idea is to combine a simple descriptor with basic functions to create 
open and integrated solutions server.

This software can be seen as an alternative of Bitnami. It provides 
Benefits are:
- Its not a repackaging, it does not hide what should be done to install a product.
    + Supplementary task can be added at any moment in installation and usage procedures.
    + Details of each action in a procedure are transparent and can be tuned.
     
- Stack can be changed/simplified/extended at will. 
    + No need to wait to be integrated by another provider if you know how to use it.
    + Any version can be used as long as they are compatible with other choosen components (the hardest trick).  
- A set of simple functions wrap Apache ANT commands.
- Basic lifecycle of installation, but supplementary lifecycles can be easily added.
- Predefined lifecycle are : install, startup, shutdown



Content
