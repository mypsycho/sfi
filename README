SFI : Software Factory Installer


This tool is an open source installer of web applications and solutions stack.

Basic stack is java-developer oriented but this tool provides global mechanisms 
which allow integration of small-footprinted applications.
It includes following applications:
- Redmine
- Sonar of Sonarsource
- Sonatype Nexus
- Jenkins CI
- Apache Maven

It works with :
- Apache Tomcat as Web server
- Mysql as database
- ApacheDS as ldap


Candidates for integrable application:
- Java or ruby (through JRuby) Virtual-machine applications
- small footprint: no resources required in any special place like etc or 'user home' folder 
(except places handled by another SFI-application).
- Configurable through ASCII file.
 


This implementation can be seen as an alternative of Bitnami.
Benefits:
- Its not a repackaging, it does not hide what should be done to install 
- You can build your own stack if you find the right candidate application for you. 
No need to wait to be integrated if you know how to use it.
- A set of simple functions wrap Apache ANT commands.
