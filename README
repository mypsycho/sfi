SFI : Software Factory Installer


This tool is an open source installer of web applications and solutions stack.


Concept
--------------
Most of current applications are based on the similar pattern:
- installation by unpack
- copy of plugins in a specific directory
- SQL and  LDAP compatibles
The main idea is to combine a simple descriptor with basic functions to create 
open and integrated solutions server.

This implementation can be seen as an alternative of Bitnami.
Benefits:
- Its not a repackaging, it does not hide what should be done to install. 
- You can build your own stack if you find an application you need. 
    + No need to wait to be integrated by another provider if you know how to use it.
    + Any version can be used as long as they are compatible with other choosen components (the hardest trick).  
- A set of simple functions wrap Apache ANT commands.
- No only you define the lifecycle of installation, but supplementary lifecycles can be easily added.
- Predefined lifecycle are : install, startup, shutdown


Description
--------------
Basic stack is java-developer oriented but this tool provides global mechanisms 
to integration of small-footprinted applications.

Basic stack includes following applications:
- Redmine
- Sonar of Sonarsource
- Sonatype Nexus
- Jenkins CI
- Apache Maven

It works on following middlewares :
- Apache Tomcat as Web server
- Mysql as database
- ApacheDS as ldap for users management


Description
--------------
Candidates for integrable application:
- Java or ruby (through JRuby) Virtual-machine applications
- Small footprint installation: 
    + no resources required in any special place like 'etc' or 
    '${user.home}' folder.
    + no update of regedit
    + no several place installations: for example, avoid
		"program files\XXX" AND "program files\common files\XXX" AND "Documents and Settings\All Users\XXX"
    (except places handled by another SFI-application).
- Configurable through ASCII files.
- Intallation must be incremental: 
    + unpack an application must not override data changed when using the application. 
- No interactive installation: as installing a full stack can last several minuts 


Building a stack
--------------
1. Descriptor engine.properties
- Define all the commands 
- Define an OS variation with engine_<os.version>.properties.

2. The meta-commands
A meta-command is sequence of command on 

3. The build-in functions
ant module (default)
download
unpack
copy
ant
configure
