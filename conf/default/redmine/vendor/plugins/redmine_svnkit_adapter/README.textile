h1. Redmine SVNKit Plugin

This plugin overrides the default Redmine Subversion adapter to make 
it use the free SVNKit java library from TMate Software instead of 
calling svn command line client.

h2. Requirements

This plugin has the following requirements:
* Redmine deployment using JRuby (I use the glassfish GEM)
* the free SVNKit java library from TMate Software
  (get it at http://www.svnkit.com)

h2. Installation and Setup

General instructions can be found in the Redmine online documentation 
(http://www.redmine.org/wiki/redmine/Plugins).
Additionally you need to copy the following JAR files from the SVNKit 
distribution to the ./lib folder in the plugin directory
(usually $REDMINE_ROOT/vendor/plugins/redmine_svnkit) :
* svnkit.jar
* trilead.jar
* [jna.jar] (optionally; see SVNKit documentation for more info)

The adapter has been tested with Redmine >= 0.9 and SVNKit 1.3.2.

h2. Usage

Once the plugin is installed, all subversion repositories are accessed
through SVNKit.
